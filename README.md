# Yottsu
A game with four quadrants of rythm. 
Yottsu aims at being a fun ~~(totally not competitive)~~ open source keyboard rythm game built on the polaris engine.

# Why is it called yottsu?
seeing that some rythm games have their name be in japanese, I though it would makes sense to have the name be in japanese.
Yottsu means 4 objects (I'm not a japanese speaker, I just used google translate) which is the main aspect of the game.
